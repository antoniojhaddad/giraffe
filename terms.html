    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of this website monitoring and uptime
      verification software-as-a-service ("Service"). By accessing or using the Service,
      you agree to be bound by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      The Service provides automated monitoring of website availability and performance.
      Users can create monitors that periodically check URLs and receive notifications
      when downtime or issues are detected.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Accounts and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      Access to certain features requires an active subscription.
      Subscriptions are billed on a recurring basis according to the selected plan.
      You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Payments and Billing</h2>
    <p>
      Payments are processed by our authorized payment provider.
      Subscription fees are charged in advance and renew automatically unless cancelled.
      You may cancel your subscription at any time, and access will remain available
      until the end of the current billing period.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>

      <li>Using the Service for illegal or harmful activities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Service Availability</h2>
    <p>
      While we aim to provide reliable monitoring, the Service is provided on an
      "as-is" and "as-available" basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect,
      incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the Service.

      are violated or if required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after
      changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
